Living Coding Guidelines
========================

Context
-------

Over time,
we have developed implicit coding standards for Registrar
through tooling rules,
reoccuring themes in code reviews,
and refactorings.
It would be good to formalize some of them
in order to make it easier for current and future developers
to maintain consistency.

This decision was spurred by
`this comment on a refactoring PR`_.

.. _this comment on a refactoring PR: https://github.com/openedx/registrar/pull/246#pullrequestreview-351727975


Decision
--------

We adopt a living `coding guidelines document`_.

.. _coding guidelines document: ../coding-guide.rst

This linked document is not meant to be exhaustive or final.
As we clarify, change, relax, or introduce coding guidelines,
it can be updated through pull requests.

Consequences
------------

The README has been updated to ask developers
to read through the guidelines before opening a pull request.

Developers are encouraged to follow the guidelines
and suggest changes to any parts of them that seem
unclear, unhelpful, or lacking.

Status
------
Accepted (circa February 2020)
